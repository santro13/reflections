Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are on github.com as way to clone other user's repository to yours. Clones are local or github copies. Branches are within a repository. Fork is to be used if you don't want to change original repository possibly due to lack of permission to modify it. Clone is to be able to pull/push to each other. Branches is to experiment code within a repository before possible merge in future.
